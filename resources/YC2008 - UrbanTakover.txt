== company & product

name: 72dpi collective / http://72dpiarmy.com
phone: +43 650 6667989 (oneup)
team: oneup stereotype sushimako consti

product: UrbanTakeover - a google maps/flickr/twitter based game http://urbantakeover.at


== What are we going to make?

We're creating a game. People "claim" spots in the city by marking them in the real world using stickers and then sending us the spot name+location via text message (or GPS enabled camera, via the website, iPhone app, ...). Players fight for monthly highscore fame.

Players can get branded sticker packs for free (advertisement backed) or buy Stickers (optional: custom cut).

Besides advertising (ie: Marketing Teams posting stickers), the data we collect through the game (spotname + location + image) can be used for Microsoft Photosynth or plain old geolocation tagging, just widespread. Additional Ideas pending (We pick up new uses as we play along with our prototype).

It's an Augmented Reality Game / Guerilla Marketing Tool using Streetart Paradigms, Google Maps, Flickr, Twitter, Short Message Services and Rounded Corners.

=== oneup hacks non-computer systems

This one time, at band camp, I founded the Austrian Pirate Party. In 2007 co-organized the first European Pirate Party Conference: http://nextsteppolitics09.org/

This opened a backdoor to the Viennese art scene / art funding scene, got me contacts in all over europe and in the Austrian media landscape.



=== what our team did together in the past

Leo & Florian created BeatNinja together. A prototype for a timing based music game. http://vimeo.com/701096


All team members each other for approximately 1 1/2 years. We met at the Viennese hackerspace "metalab" (http://metalab.at).


== What's new about what we're doing?

The idea of Geolocation based gaming exists, but has not yet been taken further than scavenger hunt games.


== What we understand, that other companies don't

Florian H. has experience in Streetart through co-founding http://graffitiresearchlab.at.

Most of us played Magic the Gathering and know the addictiveness of Trading Card games. Combined with Streetart Culture and Stickers designed by Artists from the Scene this makes an addictive mix.

Also: We want to reclaim our city!!!


== Competitors

Kirkland North et al. are similar, but focusses on moving troops around, where our players redefine the playscape on the fly. (Round based Risk against 3D FPS style Capture The Flag)

German clone: http://web194.login-62.hoststar.ch/targot/ (Funded by techies, no clue about gaming)


== How will we make money

* Offering sticker subscriptions to players
* Advertisement on free stickers
* Promotion Teams with Branded Stickers
* Sub-games in the game as Guerilla Marketing


== time invested so far / LOC 

About a month, 1100 Lines of Ruby.

+ Teach the internet image recognition
+ Have fun playing Dungeons & Dragons in "Real Life"
+ Or "DeadRising" photography mode. ;)


== Something surprising

Fight Night Round 2 on the XBox 360 is this console generations Tetris. Even though the game is a Boxing Simulation (...), the game mechanics are more like a reaction based puzzle game. Also: the (non existent and still) User Interface is pure User Interface Design Awesomeness!
